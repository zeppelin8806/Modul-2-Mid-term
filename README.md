# Module One final project

This java app is a database for current gym members and their workout routines.
You are able to add new gym members to the current gym members database. `gym_members.dat`

The main menu has three options
1. Create a new gym member
2. View current gym members
3. Create a new workout routine.

### Creating a new gym member.

When you create a new gym member, you'll be asked a series of questions that will be added to the `gym_members.dat`,
and will be viewed when you 'View current gym members'.

### View current gym members.
This will view current gym members and any gym members that have just been added.

### Creat a new workout routine.
When you create a new workout routine, you can choose from an already existing gym member, or create a new routine.
If you choose an existing gym member, the app will read the `gym_members.dat` and will create their work out plan based on the number
of days they go to the gym in a week, and if they would like to add cardio.

The workout routines pull from two databases, `fitness_exercises.dat` & `cardio_exercises.dat`. It will group the workouts by body type,
and will give you a cardio workout to perform.
